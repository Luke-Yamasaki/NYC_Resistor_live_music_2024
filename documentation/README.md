# NYC_Resistor_live_music_2024
A Docusaurus walkthrough of the live music workshop hosted at NYC Resistor

This website is built using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.

## Installation

If you are leveraging `yarn`, please run this in your terminal:
```
$ yarn
```

If you are working with `npm`, please run:
```
npm i
```

### Local Development

For `yarn`:
```
$ yarn start
```

Npm version:
```
npm start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window at port 3000. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server, this is called `hot reloading`.

### Build

```
$ yarn build
```

```
npm run build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.
